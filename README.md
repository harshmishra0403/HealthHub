## Introduction
HealthHub is a comprehensive health management platform leveraging the MERN stack to offer a dynamic and engaging way for users to manage their health. The platform allows users to track health metrics, store health records, manage appointments, access health tips, and receive real-time notifications.

## System Architecture
HealthHub comprises three main components: the front-end, the back-end, and the database. It follows a client-server architecture, where the front-end serves as the client and the back-end and database serve as the server.

### Front-end
The front-end, built using ReactJS, facilitates the creation of dynamic and responsive user interfaces. It communicates with the back-end through RESTful API calls.

#### Front End Pages
**For Users:**
- **Homepage:** Introduces the platform with links to key functionalities.
- **Dashboard:** Displays an overview of health metrics and recent activities.
- **Health Records:** Allows users to view and manage their health records.
- **Appointment Management:** Enables users to schedule and manage appointments with healthcare providers.
- **Health Tips and Articles:** Provides access to curated health tips and articles.
- **Notifications:** Shows real-time notifications for upcoming appointments and health alerts.
- **User Profile:** Allows users to view and edit their profile details.

#### Front-end Tools and Libraries
- **ReactJS:** Framework for building user interfaces.
- **CSS and Tailwind:** Styling frameworks.
- **Redux:** State management library.

### Back-end
The back-end, built using NodeJS and ExpressJS, provides APIs for the front-end to consume. These APIs cover functionalities such as user authentication, health record management, appointment scheduling, and notifications. The back-end also handles logic for processing and storing user data and health-related content.

#### Back-end Features
- **User Authentication and Authorization:** Supports sign-up and login using email and passwords, OTP verification, and password recovery.
- **Health Record Management:** Allows users to securely store and manage their health records.
- **Appointment Management:** Enables users to schedule and manage appointments.
- **Health Tips and Articles:** Allows administrators to manage health-related content.
- **Notifications:** Real-time notifications for users regarding appointments and health alerts.

#### Back-end Frameworks, Libraries, and Tools
- **Node.js:** Primary framework for the back-end.
- **Express.js:** Web application framework.
- **MongoDB:** Primary database for flexible and scalable data storage.
- **JWT:** Authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Bcrypt:** Password hashing for added security.
- **Mongoose:** ODM library for interacting with MongoDB.

### Database
The database for HealthHub is built using MongoDB, a NoSQL database that provides flexible and scalable data storage. It stores health records, user data, appointment details, and other relevant information.

## API Design
HealthHub's API is designed following the REST architectural style. It is implemented using Node.js and Express.js, using JSON for data exchange and standard HTTP request methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

For detailed API documentation and endpoints, refer to the [API Documentation](link-to-api-documentation).

   MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-url>
   JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret-key>
   ```

## Usage
1. Start the server:
   ```sh
   cd server
   npm start
   ```
2. Open a new terminal and navigate to the client directory:
   ```sh
   cd ../client
   ```
3. Start the React development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
4. Access the application in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

HealthHub is designed to provide a seamless and efficient way for users to manage their health, access health-related information, and stay updated with real-time notifications.
